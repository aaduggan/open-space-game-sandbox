## How to Open a Support Question
1. Determine if your question has already been asked by others

        * [GitHub Page](https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game.github.io/issues?q=label%3Aquestion+is%3Aall) - The web-page and other public documents
    * If you find the question then there's no need to open another ticket.
    * If you do not feel the question has been thoroughly answered, then comment on it and ask for more clarification
2. Create a Question Issue
    * Choose the most appropriate repository for your question:
        * [Project](https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game/issues/new?template=Custom.md)
        * [Studio](https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game-assets/issues/new?template=Custom.md)

        * [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game-github.io/issues/new?template=Custom.md)
    * Add the "question" label when creating (found to the right of the text input)
    * Try to be as detailed as possible
    * Try to use clear and direct language as much as possible
3. Check back, or enable the notification options, to see the answer to your question
    * Keep in mind that everyone is here in their free time and there may be gaps when responses are slow.    Feel free to set the notification settings for the question so you'll know immediately when its answered.
